# Few-Mode-Fiber
Analysis of efficiency and capacity of few mode optical fibers.
# Introduction
A breif detail about fibers and the physics behind is discussed followed by how to use the code.
# Modal Delay
Inter modal delay or modal delay appears only in multi mode fibers. This is due to the different group velocity of each mode at a single frequency. the maximum pulse broadening arises due to the longest and the shortest path traveled by the modes.
Hence T=T_max-T_min.
Generally Fiber capacity is defined by bit-rate distance product (BL)
Where distance L, is the possible transmission distance.
For a given signal to remain distinguishable at the receiver end. The pulse spread should be less than 1/B, which is the width of a bit period.
This means simply that the Modal Delay should be less than 1/B.
